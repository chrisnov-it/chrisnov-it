## 👨‍💻 The Story: From Reba Rakas to Chrisnov IT
I am **Frumensius Sefridus**, widely known in the dev community as **Umek**. My digital journey began as `@rebarakaz`—a tribute to my home village, **Rakas**, in Manggarai, Flores. 

Today, I build under the brand **Chrisnov IT Solutions**, a name dedicated to my two sons, **Christian** and **Reynov**. Every server I harden and every line of code I commit is a foundation for their legacy.
